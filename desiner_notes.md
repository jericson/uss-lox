## Cribbage and submariners

Lord Nelson and Lord Quilliam played cribbage while en-route to Battle
of Trafalgar. By coincidence, [Lord Nelson was a decedent of the man
who invented the
game](https://cribbageinthecounties.wordpress.com/interlude-3-sucklings/). 


Perhaps more relevant to our subject is this quote from &mdash;_Wahoo:
The Patrols of America's Most Famous World War II > Submarine_ By
Richard O'Kane:

> _Twenty-nine cribbage hand held by Lieutenant Commander Oâ€™Kane and
> dealt by Captain Morton in the U.S.S. Wahoo ten miles north of
> Shantung Promontory at 2030, March 18, 1943. Mathematicians Cedric
> G. Larson and Dick Cornwell independently figured the odds against
> this hand at 216,580; against a 28 hand at 15,028._

This was the caption on an image showing a hand of all four 5s and a
jack. Each card is signed by what I assume must be a witness to the
game. O'Kane continued:

> A host of omens concerning ships and the seas as accumulated over
> the ages. Once taken seriously, most are given but a smile
> today. But if the greetings I received from a fair portion of the
> crew&mdash;the rubbing of their palms together at chin height, like
> a crapshooter&mdash;were and indication, they believed this
> twenty-nine hand was a good omen, portending success for our ship.

## Design process

After playing [_Battle Card: Market
Garden_](https://jlericson.com/2023/01/20/market_garden.html), I
thought I'd try my hand at a similar style of game. It needed to be:

* solo only,
* roughly 5-10 minutes to play,
* focused on modeling a battle/conflict even if it makes the game
  itself less interesting,[^1]
* uses standard components (dice, deck of cards, etc.) and
* encourages experimentation.

My initial idea was to simulate the Battle of Helm's Deep from the
_Lord of the Rings_ books. But after playing around with the idea, I
realized I was converging on more of a re-theme of the _Market Garden_
campaign but from the defender's point of view. It's an idea I might
come back to eventually.

Meanwhile, I was thinking of designing a more complicated solo game
with a submarine warfare theme. The idea was to simulate an encounter
with a convoy with hex maps and a combat resolution table (CRT) that
used several factors (range, angles, etc.) to determine the odds of a
torpedo hit. After each encounter, the player would adjust tracks
representing torpedoes, supply, morale, fuel and damage. It was
shaping up to be a serious research project.

Along the way, I discovered that the war patrol reports of US
submarines have been declassified and [uploaded to the
internet](https://maritime.org/doc/subreports.php). It's just an
incredible wealth of information about how submarines and their crews
performed.[^2] Simulating these factors with pencil and paper would be
overwhelming. So I went back to the drawing board and create a _Battle
Card_-type game with a submarine theme.

My [first
attempt](https://github.com/jericson/uss-lox/blob/29b84bb877437569e09fd7f574294de5514e33db/rules.md)
involved a die, a lookup table and an alternating crib. It wasn't very
interesting to play and it definitely didn't feel like being the
captain of a submarine. 

[^1]: But if it turns out to be a fun game, so much the better!

[^2]: This data was extremely useful for the Navy to diagnose problems
    in order to improve performance in future war patrols. I should
    also say some of these reports are pretty racist by modern
    standards.
