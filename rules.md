# USS Lox

During the second world war, submarines came into their own as
instruments of war. In the Pacific theater, US submarines disrupted
Japanese shipping of supplies, material and personnel. Unlike the
German wolf pack strategy, US submarine captains usually operated
independently. _USS Lox_ follows a (fictional) Salmon-class boat on
patrol off the coast of Japan. You are the captain responsible for 58
officers and enlisted submariners. Your mission is to sink as much
enemy shipping as possible.

## Setup

You will need:

* a standard deck of 52 cards and
* a copy of these rules.

Shuffle the cards. Deal 24 cards face down to represent your torpedo
supply and set aside the rest of the deck. From the torpedo supply,
deal (face down) a three by three grid of cards to represent the
Pacific Ocean.

## Turn order

Each turn represents an encounter with an enemy convoy. The game ends
when the USS Lox runs out of cards in the torpedo deck, is sunk by
enemy forces (4b) or the player decides to return to port (5).

1. **Up periscope**&mdash;Flip any card in the 3x3 grid. The card
   represents the ship you may chose to attack.

2. **Attack decision**&mdash;Captain decides whether the situation is
   favorable.

    a. If you decide not to attack, discard the ship and continue the
    war patrol with another **up periscope** step.
   
    b. Otherwise, place 0 to 3 cards from your torpedo supply face down
    on the table.

3. **Torpedoes away!**&mdash;Determine if you sank the ship based on
   whether your cards scored any point according to the rules of
   cribbage.

    a. If the revealed ship is a Jack, it's immediately sunk with the
    USS Lox's deck gun. No torpedoes are expended.

    b. Using the revealed ship card and all torpedo cards, the ship is
     sunk if there is at least one: 
     
     * pair
     * set of cards that add up to 15
     * run of three or more cards (Ace is low and the cards need not match suit.)
     * all four cards are of the same suit
     
   c. If there is no way to score any points with the ship and torpedo
   cards, the ship escapes without damage and the USS Lox must attempt
   to evade escorts.

4. **Run silent**&mdash;Attempt to escape the escorts.

   a. If the ship was sunk in the attack, the USS Lox slips away
   automatically in the confusion. **Place the ship in your score
   pile.**
   
   b. If the attack failed, **discard the ship and draw another ship
   from the deck**. It is an enemy escort ship barring down on your
   position. You may either:
      * Discard as many cards from your torpedo deck as shown on the
        escort card. (Ace is 1 and face cards are 10). Place them face
        down at the bottom of the . If you don't have enough torpedoes
        to discard, **the USS Lox has been lost at sea with all
        crew**.
      * Attempt an attack on the escort using procedure in (3)
        **Torpedoes away!**. If the attack succeeds place the escort
        in the score pile. If the attack fails, **the USS Lox has been
        destroyed**.

5. **Debrief**&mdash;Decide whether to return to port or continue on
   patrol.
   
   You may decide to end the war patrol and begin scoring or continue
   another turn starting at **Up periscope** (1).
    
## War patrol report

The game ends in one of three ways:

1. The USS Lox is sunk by an escort (4b),
2. You decide to end the patrol (5) or
3. There are no more ships to flip in the ocean (1).

If the USS Lox returns to port, that's a win. If the USS Lox is sunk,
it counts as a loss, but you can still score up any tonnage you might
have sunk.

Add up the number on all sunk ship cards (aces are 1 and face cards
are 10) and multiply by 1,000 tons. (Example: If you sink ace, three,
and queen, that ads up to 14,000 tons.)

The average patrol sunk 3298 tons. The _USS Tang_ sank 96,628 tons in
5 patrols (average of 19,326 tons a patrol), but was sunk by her own
torpedo on October 24, 1944. _USS Flasher_ sank 100,131 tons in 6
patrols (16,689 per patrol) and was starting her seventh when the war
ended.

## Advanced rules

Once you've played once or twice, add in these to make the game more
challenging.

### Jokers

During setup, shuffle two jokers into the deck. If you flip a joker in
the **Up periscope** (1) step, immediately draw an escort (4b). If one
of your torpedoes in an attack (3b) is a joker, your attack fails and
you must face an escort. If the attack is against an escort, the USS
Lox is sunk.

### Sinking face cards

When you sink a face card ship (jack, queen or king), discard the ship
and place a card from the deck (face down) in your sunk ship pile. At
the end of the patrol, naval intelligence estimates their tonnage and
you can score these cards as normal.

### Plan your patrol

When laying out the grid of cards in the ocean, you may place as many
as you like. More cards represent longer patrols, but you'll have
fewer torpedoes to fire. Shorter patrols allow captains to use more
torpedoes.

### King ships

If you flip a king ship (1), it's an escort ship. You must either take
damage or attack (4b).

### Queen ship

If you sink a queen ship (3b), you may decide to flip another ship
from the deck as an opportunity target. You can decide whether or not
to attack (2) as if it were a normal ship.

## Cribbage scoring

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_cribbage#The_show):

* fifteens
  * 2 points for each distinct combination of two or more cards totalling exactly fifteen (counting aces as one, face cards as ten)
* runs
  * 3 points for a run of three consecutive cards (regardless of suit)
  * 4 points for a run of four
  * 5 points for a run of five
* pairs
  * 2 points for a pair of cards of the same rank
  * 6 points for three cards of the same rank (known as a "pair royal", comprising three distinct pairs)
  * 12 points for four cards of the same rank (a "double pair royal", comprising six distinct pairs)
* flush
  * 4 points for a flush, where all four cards in the hand are of the same suit, with an additional point if the starter card is also of that suit. (Note that four suited cards including the starter, but missing one of the cards in the hand, does not score for flush.)
* his nob
  * 1 point for holding the jack of the same suit as the starter card
* his heals
  * 2 points to the dealer if the starter card is a jack
