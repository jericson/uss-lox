# USS Lox

During the second world war, submarines came into their own as
instruments of war. In the Pacific theater, US submarines disrupted
Japanese shipping of supplies, material and personnel. Unlike the
German wolf pack strategy, US submarine captains usually operated
independently. _USS Lox_ follows a (fictional) Salmon-class boat on
patrol off the coast of Japan.

## Setup

You will need:

* One 6-sided die
* A standard deck of 52 cards
* A copy of these rules

Shuffle the cards. Deal out a three by three grid of face down cards to
represent the Pacific Ocean. keep the rest of the deck near at hand.

## Turn order

1. **Encounter convoy**&mdash;Flip any card in the 3x3 grid. The card
   represents the convoy you may chose to attack.
2. **Up periscope**&mdash;Draw 6 cards from the deck into your hand and
   draw two cards face down on the table to form half of the crib.
3. **Attack decision**&mdash;Decide whether to attack. If the
   situation is unfavorable:
   1. Place cards in your hand and the crib in a face-down discard
      pile. (Do not look at the crib!)
   2. Mark the current convoy as encountered.
   3. Start the next turn with the **convoy encounter** step.
   Otherwise, proceed with the attack plan.
4. **Torpedoes away!**&mdash;Place two cards from your hand face-down
   on the crib. Turn the top card from the deck as the starter
   card. Calculate your hand score based on the cribbage scoring rules
   below.
5. **Damage report**&mdash;Roll the 6-sided die and compare the number
   to your hand score:
   * If you roll the same number as the hand score, your attack failed
     and you were sunk by depth charges. You may tabulate a posthumous
     score, but you and your entire crew have been lost at sea.
   * If you roll higher than the hand score, your attack failed. Start
     the next turn with the **convoy encounter** step.
   * If you roll lower than the hand score, your attack
     succeeded. Record the tonnage and proceed to the crib.
 6. **Followup action**&mdash;Lookup the Crib for the current convoy:
   * If the Crib is marked "Escort", you must score the crib, roll the
     die and resolve with the following rules:
     * If the die roll _exceeds_ the crib score, you have safely
       escaped the escort. Start the next turn with the **convoy
       encounter** step.
     * If the die roll is _less than_ the crib score, your game is
       over and all hands are presumed lost at sea.
     * If the die roll matches the crib score, a snap torpedo shot has
       sunk the escort. Add 3,000 tons to your score and start the
       next turn with the **convoy encounter** step.
  * If the Crib has a number, you may take a target of opportunity and
    resolve the crib as if it were your own hand in the **damage
    report** stage. If you survive (i.e., the die roll does not match
    the Crib score), start the next turn with the **convoy encounter**
    step. Add the tonnage in the convoy's Crib column to your score
    only if you sink it by rolling lower than the crib score.
    
## Game end

The game ends in one of two ways:

1. Your submarine sinks due to rolling the same as your hand score,
  crib score (if not marked with "Escort") or less than the crib score
  if it is marked "Escort".
2 You roll a convoy that you have already encountered (whether or not
  you attack it) on a previous turn.
  
The average patrol sunk 3298 tons. The _USS Tang_ sank 96,628 tons in
5 patrols (average of 19,326 tons a patrol), but was sunk by her own
torpedo on October 24, 1944. _USS Flasher_ sank 100,131 tons in 6
patrols (16,689 per patrol) and was starting her seventh when the war
ended.

## Cribbage scoring

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_cribbage#The_show):

* fifteens
  * two points for each distinct combination of two or more cards totalling exactly fifteen (counting aces as one, face cards as ten)
* runs
  * three points for a run of three consecutive cards (regardless of suit)
  * four points for a run of four
  * five points for a run of five
* pairs
  * two points for a pair of cards of the same rank
  * six points for three cards of the same rank (known as a "pair royal", comprising three distinct pairs)
  * twelve points for four cards of the same rank (a "double pair royal", comprising six distinct pairs)
* flush
  * four points for a flush, where all four cards in the hand are of the same suit, with an additional point if the starter card is also of that suit. (Note that four suited cards including the starter, but missing one of the cards in the hand, does not score for flush.)
* his nob
  * one point for holding the jack of the same suit as the starter card
